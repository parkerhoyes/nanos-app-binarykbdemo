# Ledger Nano S Binary Keyboard Demo

This repository contains an application designed to demonstrate a "binary
keyboard" I am developing for the [Ledger Nano
S](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-nano-s).

This application also uses
[BUI](https://github.com/parkerhoyes/bolos-user-interface), the graphics library
I created as an alternative to the standard BAGL that's a part of the official
SDK for the Nano S.

## Development Cycle

This repository will follow a Git branching model similar to that described in
[Vincent Driessen's *A successful Git branching
model*](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and a
versioning scheme similar to that defined by [Semantic Versioning
2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
